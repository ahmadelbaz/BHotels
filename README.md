- When user starts booking, he will get all needed details about this new booking, and he can increase number of persons in a double room or a suite

- Note : You need to sign up to use the app, fill any dummy data and it will work

## Notes

- The app is functional, and it will be updated.
- The app is incomplete, i think its enough for what i wanted to achieve.
- With some time and effor it can be much better.
- All data in the app are dummy data, and dates are fixed and unchangable due to lack of time.
- Of course design needs many adjusments and code needs some refactoring.
